# roommate-api
RESTful HTTP API to manage the creation of unordered lists associated with organizing life with roommates (like groceries, chores, etc.).

Meant to be my first introduction to Golang and takes large portions from lair-api (https://github.com/carsonclarke570/lair-api/blob/master/)
Big shout-out to carsonclarke570 for helping me get started on this project, helping me figure out the architecture and design of this project, and letting me use a lot of his existing code!
